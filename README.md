# Permutation-GA 

A simple genetic algorithm to solve permutation problem.

This is a good introduction to simple genetic operators. Here there is an implementation of:
Tournament selection,
One-point permutation crossover and
Insert Mutation

This can be applied very easily by ammending GAOperators.evaluationSolution 

Note that there are many more types of genetic operators
